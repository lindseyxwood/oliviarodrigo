Eh, eh, eh, eh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Oh no

[Verse 1]
You can get real close, talkin', you talkin' now
Underneath our clothes, pretend that we know it all
Shut off the lights just to hide in the dark
(Hide in the) Dark, (Hide in the) dark
Think that I know you the farther you are
(Farther you are, farther you are) No

[Pre-Chorus]
Like A-B-C-D, that could work so perfectly
If perfect was the kind of thing that worked for me
But I wanna feel nervous, just a little bit off the edge
(Wanna feel, wanna feel, wanna feel)
Even if I know that I will end up in a mess

[Chorus]
Like eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, it won't be perfect
But I know, oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
It's not perfect, eh, eh, eh, but maybe that's what we need
(That's what we need)

See right through the fiction and all of this fakery
(All of this fakery)
Just give me some friction, let me see what nobody sees
(See what nobody sees)
You don't think that I can handle the truth
(Handle the truth, handle the truth)
Baby, I'm over just playing it cool, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Like A-B-C-D, that could work so perfectly
If perfect was the kind of thing that worked for me
But I wanna feel nervous, just a little bit off the edge
(Wanna feel, wanna feel, wanna feel)
Even if I know that I will end up in a mess

[Chorus]
Like eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, it won't be perfect
(And you know that I'm with you, baby)
But I know, oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it
(And I know it could be worth it, baby)
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
It's not perfect, eh, eh, eh, but maybe that's what we need

[Bridge]
That's what we need (That's what we need)
That's what we need (That's what we need)
Baby, do you think that you could give it to me?
That's what we need
That's what we need
Baby, do you think that you could give it to me?
[Chorus]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, it won't be perfect
(What you need, you and I)
But I know, oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it
(Oh, will you give it to me, baby?)
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
(Mess with me, honey)
It's not perfect, eh, eh, eh, but maybe that's what we need
(And you know, and you know, know, know)

[Outro]
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, it won't be perfect)
That's what we need, that's what we need
(But I know, oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it)
Baby, do you think that you could give it to me?
(And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara)
That's what we need, that's what we need
It's not perfect, eh, eh, eh, but maybe that's what we need28Embed
