34 ContributorsMona Lisa Lyrics[Verse 1]
Keep it casual, don't have to tippy-toe
Take your cares off, just stay a couple more
You don't have to be, don't have to be a stranger
Go and get a little closer
Playing mind games, we don't do that here
So put your bid in before I disappear
You don't have to be, don't have to be a stranger
Come and get a little closer

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't gotta hesitate
Ain't gotta make me wait
Oh, baby, won't you stay?
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Both of my eyes, they've been fixing on you
Wasting your time, should be making that move
Come and say hi, I've been dying to meet ya
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa
What's on my mind, I've been thinking maybe
I could be yours by the time that we leave
Come and say hi, I've been dying to meet ya
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa, oh

I know your type, what's with the timid behavior?
You let this ooh-la-la-la intimidate ya
Don't you make me, don't you make me leave on my own
I'm already ready, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't gotta hesitate
Ain't gotta make me wait
Oh, baby, won't you stay?
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Both of my eyes, they've been fixing on you
Wasting your time, should be making that move
Come and say hi, I've been dying to meet ya
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa
What's on my mind, I've been thinking maybe
I could be yours by the time that we leave
Come and say hi, I've been dying to meet ya
Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa, oh31Embed
