Ah

[Verse 1]
Made it clear when you told me (Ah-ah)
Don't know why, but you gotta be lonely (Ah-ah-ah)
Say it's hard, but you make it look easy (Ah-ah)
So I'm tryin' to live in reality (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Decompressin', tryna ease the tension, but you
Got me stressin', feelin' like I need to call when
You sneak up on me, tell me that you miss me in your life

[Chorus]
I can't read your mind
You say that you need to be alone
But night and day, want me at your beck and call
You say you know that you might be crossin' a line
Wastin' all our time
To think that we could be casual
You're not my friend and, baby, you never were
Why the fuss if you say you just wanna be mine?
I can't read your mind

[Verse 2]
Tell me, what's gonna happen
When it's you and me in a room, but you know you can't have it?
Oh, I'll be laughin'
When you say that you really have changed
Finally found your way
'Cause I'm close to your face (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Double-checkin', did I get the message in the way
You intended? Got me second-guessin' when you
Sneak up on me, tell me that you need me in your life

[Chorus]
I can't read your mind
You say that you need to be alone
But night and day, want me at your beck and call
You say (Uh) you know (Yeah) that you might be crossin' a line
Wastin' all our time
To think that we could be casual
You're not my friend and, baby, you never were
Why the fuss if you say you just wanna be mine?
I can't read your mind

[Bridge]
You say that you need to be alone
But night and day, want me at your beck and call
You say you know that you might be crossin' a line

[Chorus]
I can't read your mind
You say that you need to be alone
But night and day, want me at your beck and call (Want me at your beck and call)
You say you know that you might be crossin' a line
Wastin' all our time (Time)
To think (Think) that we could be casual
You're not (Not) my friend (My friend) and, baby, you never were
Why (Why) the fuss (Fuss) if you say you just wanna be mine?
I can't read your mind
[Outro]
