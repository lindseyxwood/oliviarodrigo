One year, ten thousand bad moments
But it was dressed up in heated emotion
And I tried to look for the best in the worst
But like, fuck me, that caused a commotion
You're lucky I'm a private person
I've quietly carried your burden
And everyone thinks you're an angel
But shit, I would probably use different wordin'

[Chorus]
Oh, you're so vicious
Love me, then pretend you didn't
Crush my heart and wreck my image
Why you gotta be so vicious?

[Verse 2]
You like a certain type of woman
Who's smart, but neglects intuition
When you're insecure, could be me, could be her
You just run to whoever is winnin' (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Said that it was me and you for life
Now you're kinda acting like I died
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, you're so vicious
Love me, then pretend you didn't
Crush my heart and wreck my image
Why you gotta be so, so, so
Oh, you're so vicious (No)
Love me, then pretend you didn't
Half of me just can't resist it
Why you gotta be so vicious?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, no
Why you gotta be so
Oh, oh
Why you gotta be so vicious?

[Bridge]
You don't feel remorse, you don't feel the effects
'Cause you don't think you hurt me if you wish me the best
I shoulda known all along, I was only the next one
To take your love songs as a promise

[Outro]
Oh, you're so vicious
I loved you, but I wish I didn't
If you're out there somewhere listenin'
Why you gotta be so vicious?19Embed
