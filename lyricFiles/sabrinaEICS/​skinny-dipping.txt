It'll be a Wednesday
And I'll be goin' to this coffee shop
Hear the barista call an oat milk latte and your name
And I look up from my phone
And think there's no chance it's you, but it is
You'll say, "Hi," I'll say, "Hi, how are you?"
You'll say, "How's your family? How's your sister?"
I'll say, "Shannon's bein' Shannon"
After a minute of nonsensical chatter, you'll say
"Well, this was really nice, maybe we should do this on purpose sometime"
And it'll have been long enough that we won't harp on (Hmm)

[Pre-Chorus]
Arguments in your garage
All the ways we sabotaged it (Mmm)
What it was and what it wasn't

[Chorus]
We've been swimmin' on the edge of a cliff
I'm resistant, but goin' down with the ship
It'd bе so nice, right? Right?
If we could take it all off and just еxist
And skinny dip in water under the bridge

[Verse 2]
You'll suggest a restaurant we used to go to
And I'll say, "Won't that be too nostalgic?"
And you'll say, "Maybe, but let's do it anyway
We won't sit at our same old table, I promise
And we won't bring up the past, we'll keep it bureaucratic"
And we won't say it, but both of us, we'll be thinkin' about
How different we are from those scared little kids that had those (Hmm)

Arguments in your garage
All the ways we sabotaged it (Mmm)
What it was and what it wasn't

[Chorus]
We've been swimmin' on the edge of a cliff
I'm resistant, but goin' down with the ship
It'd be so nice, right? Right?
If we could take it all off and just exist
And skinny dip in water under the bridge

[Bridge]
Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ha
Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ha
Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ha
Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ha

[Outro]
We've been swimmin' on the edge of a cliff
I'm resistant, but goin' down with the ship
It'd be so nice, right? Right
If we could take it all off and just exist
And skinny dip in water under the bridge23Embed
