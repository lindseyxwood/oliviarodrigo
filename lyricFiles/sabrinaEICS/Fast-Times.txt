Sun's up too soon like daylight savings
Mixed emotions are congregating
Picturin' us in all these places
Ahead of myself's an understatement
Sky looks so purple, I can taste it
Couple days in, I call you "baby"
Three stories up here contemplatin'
But what the fuck is patience?

[Chorus]
These are fast times and fast nights, yeah
No time for rewrites, we couldn't help it
Outlines on bed sides, yeah
Give me a second to forget I evеr really meant it
Fast times and fast nights, yеah
Closed eyes and closed blinds, we couldn't help it
Outlines on bed sides, yeah
Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it

[Verse 2]
My feelings used to be serrated
But you speak in such a perfect cadence
Tiptoeing past so many stages
But what the fuck is patience?

Outlines on bed sides, yeah
Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it
