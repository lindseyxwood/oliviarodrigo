You're good at the fallin', not the stayin' there
You're good at the givin' too much, then gettin' scared
You're good at impersonating someone who cares
And you had me for a minute there

[Pre-Chorus]
But now I wonder why
I let your confusion keep me up at night
I'm so tired
Reread every single undertone and I

[Chorus]
Overanalyzed it
Front, back, and beside it
Where else can we go?
There's nothin' left hеre to decode
Donе lookin' for signs in
The gaps and the silence
It's just gettin' old
There's nothin' left here to decode

[Post-Chorus]
Mm, mm-mm

[Verse 2]
There's a weight off my shoulders now that I don't chase you
Bein' myself, did that emasculate you?
Learnin' from you that I can walk away too
And you had me for a minute too
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
But now I wonder why
I let your indecision keep me up at night
I'm so tired
Unpacked every single word you wrote and I

[Chorus]
Overanalyzed it
Front, back, and beside it
Where else can we go?
There's nothin' left here to decode
Done lookin' for signs in
The gaps and the silence
It's just gettin' old
There's nothin' left here to decode

[Post-Chorus]
Mm, mm-mm
There's nothin' left here to decode
Mm, mm-mm

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I wonder why
I let your confusion keep me up at night
I'm so tired
Reread every single undertone and I
[Chorus]
Overanalyzed it
Front, back, and beside it
Where else can we go?
There's nothin' left here to decode
Done lookin' for signs in
The gaps and the silence
It's just gettin' old
There's nothin' left here to decode

[Post-Chorus]
There's nothin', there's nothin', there's nothin' (Mm, mm-mm)
There's nothin' left here to decode
There's nothin', there's nothin', there's nothin' (No, mm)
There's nothin' left here to decode
