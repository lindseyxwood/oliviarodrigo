Know that I loved you so bad
I let you treat me like that
I was your willing accomplice, honey
And I watched as you fled the scene
Doe-eyed as you buried me
One heart broke, four hands bloody

[Chorus]
The things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

[Verse 2]
You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
And I defended you to all my friends
And now every time a siren sounds
I wondеr if you're around
'Cause you know that I'd do it all again

[Chorus]
All the things I did
Just so I could call you minе
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

It's bittersweet to think about the damage that we'd do
'Cause I was goin' down, but I was doin' it with you
Yeah, everything we broke and all the trouble that we made
But I say that I hate you with a smile on my face
Oh, look what we became

[Chorus]
All the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
All the things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

[Outro]
Your favorite crime
Your favorite crime
'Cause, baby, you were mine75Embed
