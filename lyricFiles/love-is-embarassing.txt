I told my friends you were the one
After I'd known you, like, a month
And then you kissed some girl from high school
And I stayed in bed for, like, a week
When you said space was what you need
Waited by my phone like a goddamn fool

[Chorus]
And now it don't mean a thing
God, love's fuckin' embarrassin'
Just watch as I crucify myself
For some weird second string
Loser who's not worth mentioning
My God, love's embarrassing as hell

[Verse 2]
And I consoled you while you cried
Over your ex-girlfriend's new guy
My God, how could I be so stupid?
You found a new version of me
And I damn near startеd World War III
Jesus, what was I even doin'?

[Chorus]
'Causе now it don't mean a thing
God, love's fuckin' embarrassin'
Just watch as I crucify myself
For some weird second string
Loser who's not worth mentioning
My God, love's embarrassing as hell

I give up, give up, I give up everything
I placed my bets, and it's not worth anything
I give up, give up, but I keep comin' back for more, yeah

[Chorus]
It don't mean a thing
God, love's fuckin' embarrassin'
Just watch as I crucify myself, hey, hey, hey
For some weird second string
Loser who's not worth mentioning
My God, love's embarrassing as hell

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, I give up (Ah), give up, I give up everything (Ah-ha-ha)
I'm plannin' out my wedding with some guy I'm never marryin'
I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up, but I keep comin' back for more10Embed
