Hope I never see you in the right light (Right light)
Hope I always catch you at the wrong time (Wrong time)
If you let me take a picture of your bad side (Bad side)
And you like it, well, that's a good sign, hey (Yep)
I know you're not a fan of double texting (Texting)
But you don't always gotta leave me guessing (Guessing)
I know you wanna leave a good impression
But you did it, you did without tryin', oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I like your soul when it's shirtless
'Cause it's just like mine
I like your hands when they're nervous
And they're all over mine, like yeah
Show me under the surface (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And we can cross that line (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
When you stop acting perfect

[Chorus]
Baby, take off all your cool
Cool, cool
I'll take off mine too when you take off all your cool
Cool, cool
I'll take off mine too when you take it all off
You might also like[Verse 2]
We could even kick it in the driveway (Kick it)
'Cause you know I'm not tryna over-complicate
If showin' all your colors led to heartbreak (Heartbreak)
Then let it break on me, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I like your soul when it's shirtless
'Cause it's just like mine
I like your hands when they're nervous
And they're all over mine, like yeah
Show me under the surface (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And we can cross that line (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
When you stop acting perfect

[Chorus]
Baby, take off all your cool
Cool, cool
I'll take off mine too when you take off all your cool
Cool, cool
I'll take off mine too when you take it all off

[Bridge]
Don't play hard to get (Don't say that)
Be hard to forget (No, baby)
Don't play hard to get, no ('Cause you give me that high)
Don't play hard to get (Don't say that)
Be hard to forget (No, baby)
Don't play hard to get ('Cause you give me that)
(Take it, take it, baby)
[Chorus]
Baby, take off all your cool
Cool, cool
I'll take off mine too when you take off all your cool
Cool, cool
I'll take off mine too when you take it all off
(Take it off, take it off, yeah, babe)

[Outro]
(Cool)
When you take it all off (Cool)
When you take it all off (Cool)
Baby, I'll take off mine too
When you take off all your cool (Cool)
When you take it all off (Cool)
When you take it all off (Cool)
Baby, I'll take off mine too9Embed
