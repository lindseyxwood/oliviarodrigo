I picked you out 'cause you were shiny and new
Had all the features, even came with tattoos

[Pre-Chorus]
But I just figured out now what hindsight means
Up until now, never had any reason to
Wish that I didn't, but now I do
The hell do I do with all these receipts?
Every moment that I ever spent on you
Shoulda just bought a new pair of shoes

[Chorus]
(Eh, eh, eh)
I wanna take you back, take you back, oh
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you
(Eh, eh, eh)
I wanna take you back, take you back, I
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you

[Post-Chorus]
(Ah, ah, ah-ah, la la la la)
I wanna put you back, na-na
(Ah, ah, ah-ah, la la la la)

Closest I've ever come to buyer's remorse
If you don't make me happy, then what good are you for?

[Pre-Chorus]
But I just figured out now what hindsight means
Up until now, never had any reason to
Wish that I didn't, but now I do
The hell do I do with all these receipts?
Every moment that I ever spent on you
Shoulda just bought a new pair of shoes

[Chorus]
(Eh, eh, eh)
I wanna take you back, take you back, oh
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you
(I wanna put you back, na-na)
(Eh, eh, eh)
I wanna take you back, take you back, I
(Take you back, wanna take you back)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you

[Bridge]
(Eh, eh, eh)
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it is broke, then go get rid of it, rid of it
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it is broke, then go get rid of it, say it again (Rid of it, rid of it, na)
(Eh, eh, eh)
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it is broke, then go get rid of it, rid of it
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it is broke, then go get rid of it, say it again
[Chorus]
(Eh, eh, eh)
I wanna take you back, take you back, oh (No)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you
(Where you came from)
(Eh, eh, eh)
I wanna take you back, take you back, I
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wanna put you back, put you back where I found you

[Outro]
(Ah, ah, ah-ah, la la la la)
I wanna put you back where I found you
Back to where you came from
(Ah, ah, ah-ah, la la la la)
No, no, no, no, no
(Eh, eh, eh)
(Ah, ah, ah-ah, la la la la)
I wanna take you back, oh no
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Ah, ah, ah-ah, la la la la)9Embed
