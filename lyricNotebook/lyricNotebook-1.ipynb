To be certain we\\'ll be tall again Whether weather be the frost Or the violence of the dog days I\\'m on waves, out being tossed Is there a line that I could just go cross? And when I was shipwrecked (Can\\'t think of all the cost now) I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now) In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?) I dreamed of you (To be certain we\\'ll be tall again) (If you think of all the cost) It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost) To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days) (Or the violence of the dog days) (Out on waves, being tossed) (I\\'m on waves, out being tossed) But I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)

And if this is the long haul How\\'d we get here so soon? Did I close my fist around something delicate? Did I shatter you? And I\\'m sitting on a bench in Coney Island Wondering, where did my baby go? The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go Sorry for not making you my centerfold Over and over Lost again with no surprises Disappointments, close your eyes And it gets colder and colder When the sun goes down The question pounds my head What\\'s a lifetime of achievement If I pushed you to the edge But you were too polite to leave me? And do you miss the rogue Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there? Will you forgive my soul When you\\'re too wise to trust me and too old to care? \\'Cause we were like the mall before the internet It was the one place to be The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring Over and over Lost again with no surprises Disappointments, close your eyes And it gets colder and colder When the sun goes down Were you waiting at our old spot In the tree line by the gold clock Did I leave you hanging every single day? Were you standing in the hallway With a big cake, happy birthday Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey? A universe away And when I got into the accident The sight that flashed before me was your face But when I walked up to the podium I think that I forgot to say your name I\\'m on a bench in Coney Island Wondering, where did my baby go? The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go Sorry for not making you my centerfold Over and over Lost again with no surprises Disappointments, close your eyes And it gets colder and colder When the sun goes down When the sun goes down The sight that flashed before me was your face When the sun goes down But I think that I forgot to say your name Over and over Sorry for not making you my, making you my Making you my centerfold Gleaming, twinkling Eyes like sinking Ships on waters So inviting, I almost jump in But I don\\'t like a gold rush, gold rush I don\\'t like anticipatin\\' my face in a red flush I don\\'t like that anyone would die to feel your touch Everybody wants you Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you Walk past, quick brush I don\\'t like slow motion, double vision in rose blush I don\\'t like that falling feels like flying \\'til the bone crush Everybody wants you But I don\\'t like a gold rush What must it be like to grow up that beautiful? With your hair falling into place like dominoes I see me padding across your wooden floors With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit And the coastal town we wandered \\'round had nеver seen a love as pure as it And thеn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea \\'Cause it could never be \\'Cause I don\\'t like a gold rush, gold rush I don\\'t like anticipatin\\' my face in a red flush I don\\'t like that anyone would die to feel your touch Everybody wants you Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you Walk past, quick brush I don\\'t like slow motion, double vision in rose blush I don\\'t like that falling feels like flying \\'til the bone crush Everybody wants you But I don\\'t like a gold rush What must it be like to grow up that beautiful? With your hair falling into place like dominoes My mind turns your life into folklore I can\\'t dare to dream about you anymore At dinner parties, I won\\'t call you out on your contrarian shit And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it \\'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea \\'Cause it will never be Gleaming, twinkling Eyes like sinking Ships on waters So inviting, I almost jump in You booked the night train for a reason So you could sit there in this hurt Bustling crowds or silent sleepers You\\'re not sure which is worse Because I dropped your hand while dancing Left you\\u205fout\\u205fthere\\u205fstanding Crestfallen on the\\u205flanding Champagne problems Your mom\\'s\\u205fring in your pocket My picture in your wallet Your heart was glass, I dropped it Champagne problems You told your family for a reason You couldn\\'t keep it in Your sister splashed out on the bottle Now no one\\'s celebrating Dom Pérignon, you brought it No crowd of friends applauded Your hometown skeptics called it Champagne problems You had a speech, you\\'re speechless Love slipped beyond your reaches And I couldn\\'t give a reason Champagne problems Your Midas touch on the Chevy door November flush and your flannel cure \"This dorm was once a madhouse\" I made a joke, \"Well, it\\'s made for me\" How evergreen, our group of friends Don\\'t think we\\'ll say that word again And soon they\\'ll have the nerve to deck the halls That we once walked through One for the money, two for the show I never was ready so I watch you go Sometimes you just don\\'t know the answer \\'Til someone\\'s on their knees and asks you \"She would\\'ve made such a lovely bride What a shame she\\'s fucked in the head,\" they said But you\\'ll find the real thing instead She\\'ll patch up your tapestry that I shred And hold your hand while dancing Never leave you standing Crestfallen on the landing With champagne problems Your mom\\'s ring in your pocket Her picture in your wallet You won\\'t remember all my Champagne problems You won\\'t remember all my Champagne problems Never be so kind You forget to be clever Never be so clever You forget to be kind And if I didn\\'t know better I\\'d think you were talking to me now If I didn\\'t know better I\\'d think you were still around What died didn\\'t stay dead What died didn\\'t stay dead You\\'re alive, you\\'re alive in my head What died didn\\'t stay dead What died didn\\'t stay dead You\\'re alive, so alive Never be so politе You forget your power Nevеr wield such power You forget to be polite And if I didn\\'t know better I\\'d think you were listening to me now If I didn\\'t know better I\\'d think you were still around What died didn\\'t stay dead What died didn\\'t stay dead You\\'re alive, you\\'re alive in my head What died didn\\'t stay dead What died didn\\'t stay dead You\\'re alive, so alive The autumn chill that wakes me up You loved the amber skies so much Long limbs and frozen swims You\\'d always go past where our feet could touch And I complained the whole way there The car ride back and up the stairs I should\\'ve asked you questions I should\\'ve asked you how to be Asked you to write it down for me Should\\'ve kept every grocery store receipt \\'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me Watched as you signed your name Marjorie All your closets of backlogged dreams And how you left them all to me What died didn\\'t stay dead What died didn\\'t stay dead You\\'re alive, you\\'re alive in my head What died didn\\'t stay dead What died didn\\'t stay dead You\\'re alive, so alive And if I didn\\'t know better I\\'d think you were singing to me now If I didn\\'t know better I\\'d think you were still around I know better But I still feel you all around I know better But you\\'re still around And the tennis court was covered up With some tent-like thing And you asked me to dance But I said, \"Dancin\\' is a dangerous game\" Oh, I thought This is gonna be one of those things Now I know I\\'m never gonna love again I\\'ve got some tricks up my sleeve Takes one to know one You\\'re a cowboy like me Never wanted love Just a fancy car Now I\\'m waiting by the phone Like I\\'m sitting in an airport bar You had some tricks up your sleeve Takes one to know one You\\'re a cowboy like me Perched in the dark Tellin\\' all the rich folks anything they wanna hear Like it could be love I could be the way forward Only if they pay for it You\\'re a bandit like me Eyes full of stars Hustling for the good life, never thought I\\'d meet you here It could be love We could be the way forward And I know I\\'ll pay for it You\\'re a cowboy like me Perched in the dark Tellin\\' all the rich folks anything they wanna hear Like it could be love I could be the way forward Only if they pay for it You\\'re a bandit like me Eyes full of stars Hustlin\\' for the good life, never thought I\\'d meet you here It could be love We could be the way forward And I know I\\'ll pay for it And the skeletons in both our closets Plotted hard to fuck this up And the old men that I\\'ve swindled Really did believe I was the one And the ladies lunchin\\' have their stories about When you passed through town Oh, but that was all before I locked it down Now you hang from my lips Like the Gardens of Babylon With your boots beneath my bed Forever is the sweetest con I\\'ve had some tricks up my sleeve Takes one to know one You\\'re a cowboy like me And I\\'m never gonna love again I\\'m never gonna love again I\\'m never gonna love again I\\'m like the water when your ship rolled in that night Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife And if it was an open-shut case I never would\\'ve known from that look on your face Lost in your current like a priceless wine The more that you say, the less I know Wherever you stray, I follow I\\'m begging for you to take my hand Wreck my plans, that\\'s my man Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin\\' in As if you were a mythical thing Like you were a trophy or a champion ring And there was one prize I\\'d cheat to win The more that you say, the less I know Wherever you stray, I follow I\\'m begging for you to take my hand Wreck my plans, that\\'s my man You know that my train could take you home Anywhere else is hollow I\\'m begging for you to take my hand Wreck my plans, that\\'s my man Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind They count me out time and time again Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind But I come back stronger than a \\'90s trend Wait for the signal, and I\\'ll meet you after dark Show me the places where the others gave you scars Now this is an open-shut case I guess I should\\'ve known from the look on your face Every bait-and-switch was a work of art The more that you say, the less I know Wherever you stray, I follow I\\'m begging for you to take my hand Wreck my plans, that\\'s my man You know that my train could take you home Anywhere else is hollow I\\'m begging for you to take my hand Wreck my plans, that\\'s my man The more that you say, the

for you to take my hand Wreck my plans, that\\'s my man How\\'s one to know? I\\'d meet you where the spirit meets the bones In a faith-forgotten land In from the snow Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow Tarnished but so grand And the old widow goes to the stone every day But I don\\'t, I just sit here and wait Grieving for the living Oh, goddamn My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand Taking mine, but it\\'s been promised to another Oh, I can\\'t Stop you putting roots in my dreamland My house of stone, your ivy grows And now I\\'m covered in you I wish to know The fatal flaw that makes you long to be Magnificently cursed He\\'s in the room Your opal eyes are all I wish to see He wants what\\'s only yours Oh, goddamn My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand Taking mine, but it\\'s been promised to another Oh, I can\\'t Stop you putting roots in my dreamland My house of stone, your ivy grows And now I\\'m covered Clover blooms in the fields Spring breaks loose, the time is near What would he do if he found us out? Crescent moon, coast is clear Spring breaks loose, but so does fear He\\'s gonna burn this house to the ground How\\'s one to know? I\\'d live and die for moments that we stole On begged and borrowed time So tell me to run Or dare to sit and watch what we\\'ll become And drink my husband\\'s wine Oh, goddamn My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand Taking mine, but it\\'s been promised to another Oh, I can\\'t Stop you putting roots in my dreamland My house of stone, your ivy grows And now I\\'m covered in you And I\\'m covered in you So yeah, it\\'s a fire It\\'s a goddamn blaze in the dark And you started it You started it So yeah, it\\'s a war It\\'s the goddamn fight of my life And you started it You started it Oh, I can\\'t Stop you putting roots in my dreamland My house of stone, your ivy grows And now I\\'m covered In you, in you Now I\\'m covered in you In you Fatefully I tried to pick my battles \\'til the battle picked me Misery Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep And you passed right by I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides The knife cuts both ways If the shoe fits, walk in it \\'til your high heels break And I fell from the pedestal Right down the rabbit hole Long story short, it was a bad time Pushed from the precipice Clung to the nearest lips Long story short, it was the wrong guy Now I\\'m all about you I\\'m all about you, ah Yeah, yeah I\\'m all about you, ah Yeah, yeah Actually I always felt I must look better in the rear view Missing me At the golden gates they once held the keys to When I dropped my sword I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door And we live in peace But if someone comes at us, this time, I\\'m ready \\'Cause I fell from the pedestal Right down the rabbit hole Long story short, it was a bad time Pushed from the precipice Clung to the nearest lips Long story short, it was the wrong guy Now I\\'m all about you

themselves before you get the chance to swing And he\\'s passing by Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky And he feels like home If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go And I fell from the pedestal Right down the rabbit hole Long story short, it was a bad time Pushed from the precipice Climbed right back up the cliff Long story short, I survived Now I\\'m all about you (And now) I\\'m all about you, ah (And now) I\\'m all about you (And now) I\\'m all about you, ah Yeah, yeah I\\'m all about you (And now) Yeah, yeah I\\'m all about you Long story short, it was a bad time Long story

A diamond\\'s gotta shine Best believe I\\'m still bejeweled When I walk in the room I can still make the whole place shimmer (Shimmer) And when I meet the band They ask, \"Do you have a man?\" I could still say, \"I don\\'t remember\" Familiarity breeds contempt Don\\'t put me in the basement When I want the penthouse of your heart Diamonds in my eyes I polish up real (Nice), I polish up real nice And we\\'re dancin\\' all night And you can try to change my mind But you might have to wait in line What\\'s a girl gonna do?
