    "# Networking popular words in lyrics\n",
    "For this exercise, we'll create a network of words (based on part of speech or some other classification) that are frequently used in collections of song lyrics assembled by the Olivia Rodriguez project team. For our network example, we ask: Which of the popular words is used the most frequently by particular artists? \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're adapting this to your own project, take some time with your team to think about what's interesting to explore as a network from your project. You can use this cell to sketch out in markdown what you want to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to create this network are:\n",
    "## Collect the words, rank them, and select them\n",
    "* Collect the distinct words from all of the lyrics together by part of speech. (Let's look at nouns in this example.) Return these as a sorted list with duplicates removed, ranked from most to least frequent. \n",
    "* Streamline the list, by choosing, say, the top 10 or 20 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Find out which artists use each word and how much\n",
    "* Reach into the collections assembled by artist.\n",
    "* For each word in our streamlined list, return a count of how much the artist repeats that word\n",
    "* Prepare network data (arranged as a TSV or pandas dataframe) with this structure. (The syntax will be different, but this is just an idea of the information we need.\n",
    "\n",

    "     word | used by | artist | count of times used by this artist\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative ways to develop networks of information\n",
    "There are lots of ways to think about how to explore word use in song lyrics. We are making something of a \"big picture\" study of the most popular words by part of speech used by all artists, and looking across their albums: a word is just used by an artist (regardless of which song or album it's in). But we could change this to take a closer look at other patterns. For example:\n",
    "* Change the context: word use by song or within an album!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start with a word of interest **to accept as input into the notebook** and:\n",
    "    * Look for all the ones most closely related in a collection using cosine similarity (see our early Python homework assignments to explore words similar to a word of interest).\n",
    "    * Try an adjacency network of words: Find out which other words of its type are sitting close (adjacent) to the word of interest. \n"
