                    <h3>Noun Visualization</h3>
                    <p>For our Noun Visualization, we took the top 30 nouns throughout all of
                        Olivia's, Taylor's, Billie's, and Sabrina's song and created a Network
                        Visualization based off the data. Each line connects to a word that is used
                        by an artist. The thickness of line depends on how much the artist uses the
                        word. The most used noun by these artist was "time" as it was used 191
                        times. Individually it was used by Billie "24" times, Olivia "25" times,
                        Sabrina "86" times, and Taylor "51" times. When looking at the line
                        connections, one can see the thickness variation according to their use by
                        each artist. The use of nouns like "time," "night," "day," and "daylight"
                        indicates a focus on time of day. The prominence of "love," "baby,"
                        "friend," and "boy" suggests a recurring theme of relationships and love in
                        their music. Specifically for Olivia, she used the word "love" "59" times
                        throughout her songs. This is interesting as she had the least amount of
                        songs compared to Taylor, Sabrina, and Billie. Their "love" count was "99,"
                        "56," and "44" respectively. Olivia seems to put heavy emphasis on love
                        throughout her songs.</p>

                    <p><strong>Problems:</strong> If you look closely in the Network Visualization,
                        some of the output is incorrect. Through using SpaCy and NLP(Natural
                        Language Processing) we gathered the NOUN data, however, some of the NOUNs
                        were not nouns. In our data visualization, it includes "da" and "-" which
                        are not nouns. </p>

                        <h3>Adjective Visualization</h3>
                        <p>This Adjective Visualization showcases the consistent use of the top 30
                            adjectives across all artists. Heavily used adjectives include words
                            like "bad," "good," and "well." These words specifically highlight the
                            tendency of these artists to describe something as "bad," "good," or
                            "well." Olivia uses the word "good" "27" times, while Billie, Sabrina,
                            and Taylor use it "18," "35," and "19." This is a high count considering
                            Olivia has 26 songs compared to Taylor: 46, Sabrina: 30, and Billie:
                            37.</p>

                <p><strong>Problems:</strong> We struggled to get this visualization to work with
                    PyVis. The closeness centrality is also working incorrectly, however, we are
                    looking to fix this by our project completion date. Moreover, we had the same
                    problem as we did in our Noun Visualization. There was a tendency for SpaCy and
                    NLP to pick up words like "la." As far as the accuracy of the Adjective
                    Visualization, we cannot be certain. Some words like "okay" and "only" could
                    have been picked up in a different context that was not using it as an
                    adjective.</p>

                        <p> Using AntConc's keyword analysis feature, we were able to find
                             statistically significant keywords in Olivia Rodrigo's song lyrics.
                             After identifying these top words, we looked at their Keyness (Effect),
                             which indicates how strong each of their associations are in Olivia's
                            lyrics compared to Taylor's, Billie's, and Sabrina's combined lyrics. To
                            visualize the stronger-associated words, the word cloud makes them
                            appear larger than the weaker ones. The word "I" had the highest Keyness
                            (Effect) at 0.127, followed by "and" (0.046), "so" (0.021), "all"
                            (0.020), "ah" (0.014), "him" (0.012), "back" (0.010), "her" (0.08), and
                            "she" (0.08). Words like "I", "him", "her", and "she", suggest that
                            Olivia's lyrics focus primarily on personal experiences and
                            relationships. "so", "and", "all", and "back" are words that indicate
                            the storytelling side of her lyrics, they help to convey a certain mood
                            or atmosphere.

                        <p>The “Keyness” (Likelihood) results indicate the likelihood of each word
                            being a key term in Olivia Rodrigo’s lyrics compared to the combined
                            lyrics of the other artists in her genre. The word cloud visualizes this
                            by not only making the higher values bigger, but also by its color
                            gradient that turns from dark blue to pink as the likelihood values get
                            lower. The word with the highest Keyness (Likelihood) value was “him”
                            (94.186), followed by “I” (71.399), “her” (67.193), and “logical”
                            (48.680). While the findings from the Keyness (Effect) can ultimately be
                            inferred just by listening to Olivia's songs, the Keyness (Likelihood)
                            results truly set apart Olivia's songwriting style from other pop female
                            artists. The exceptionally high likelihood values of the words "him",
                            "I", "her", and "logical" indicate just how prevelant and relied on they
                            are by Olivia compared to the other artists. These words often correlate
                            with themes of love and heartbreak, suggesting that these specific
                            themes are more central for Olivia compared to Billie, Taylor, and
                            Sabrina. </p>

                <h3>Additional Antconc Finding</h3>
                <p>Although the following information is not a visualization, we've decided to make
                    note of it here as it provides additional insight into our findings. After
                    analyzing our output data that was visualized in our PyVis noun network,
                    Olivia's frequent use of the word "love," despite her lower song count compared
                    to the other artists, was intriguing. We decided to take this information to
                    AntConc, looking specifically at the "NormRange" for the word "love" with the
                    goal of finding how statistically significant it is relative to each artist's
                    song collection. Even with Olivia having the least amount of collected songs
                    amongst the other artists, her "NormRange" for the word "love" was the highest
                    at 0.630, followed by Billie at 0.459, Taylor at 0.370, and Sabrina at 0.233.
                    This information further supports our previous reasonings that Olivia's themes
                    are greatly influenced by relationships, likely exploring deeper emotions.</p>

                    <p>This graph illustrates the song count per album for each artist. By examining
                        the number of songs in each album, we gain insights into the volume of
                        content contributed to this project and the typical output of each artist.
                        Given that Olivia only has two complete albums along with an extension of
                        her album 'GUTS', our ability to process her songs was constrained.
