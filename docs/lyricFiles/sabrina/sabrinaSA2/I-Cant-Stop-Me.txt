[Intro: Sabrina Carpenter & Saweetie]
I can't stop me, I can't stop me
Icy
I can't stop me, I can't stop me

[Verse 1: Sabrina Carpenter]
Miami Vice with the LA lights
We joyride late in the night
I don't mind, you know what you like
Yeah, you know what you like

[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Dressin' up by dressin' down
You got me feeling so new
Say we should go downtown (Go downtown)
Wake me up to lay me down
It's not like me to assume
We're going out of bounds (Out, out, out of bounds)

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
Baby, you could say you're bad for me
But who are you to tell me what I need?
'Cause I like what I like, what I li-li-like
Yeah, I like what I li-li-like
Baby, you could say you're bad for me
But who are you to tell me what I need?
'Cause I like what I like, what I li-li-like
Yeah, I like what I li-li-like
[Post-Chorus: Saweetie]
What? Ayy, I can't stop me
I can't stop, I can't, I can't stop, yeah
I can't stop, no, I can't stop me, I can't stop me
I can't stop, I can't, I can't stop, mmm
I can't stop, no, I can't stop me, I can't stop me

[Verse 2: Sabrina Carpenter & Saweetie]
All this room on top of the roof
If it's up to me, baby, you do you
No, I don't mind (I don't mind)
You know what you like (You know what I like)
Yeah, you know what you like (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter & Saweetie]
Dressin' up by dressin' down
You got me feeling so new
Say we should go downtown (Oh, we should go downtown)
Wake me up to lay me down
It's not like me to assume
We're going out of bounds (Take me out of bounds, ayy)

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter & Saweetie]
Baby, you could say you're bad for me
But who are you to tell me what I need?
'Cause I like what I like, what I li-li-like
Yeah, I like what I li-li-like (What I, what I like, ah)
Baby, you could say you're bad for me (You're bad for me)
But who are you to tell me what I need?
'Cause I like what I like, what I li-li-like
Yeah, I like what I li-li-like (What I, what I like, ayy)
I can't stop me
[Post-Chorus: Saweetie with Sabrina Carpenter]
I can't stop, I can't, I can't stop, mmm (No, no)
I can't stop, no, I can't stop me, I can't stop me
I can't stop, I can't, I can't stop, mmm
I can't stop, no, I can't stop me, I can't stop me

[Bridge: Saweetie]
Ayy, ice on, ice on, ice on me (Yeah)
All the things I like on me (Uh huh)
Louis Vuitton, all the spikes
Louis Vuitton, name the price
I like my whips exotic (Yeah)
I like my nights erotic
Yeah, pussy so aquatic, so it make that boy psychotic (Yeah)
Ice all in my mouth, snowfall when I'm talking loud
Yeah, he always want me with him
Show me off 'cause he so proud (Yeah)
Back and forth, I hop up on it, he like when I call the shots
Told him drop the top up off the foreign and don't ever stop

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter & Saweetie]
Baby, you could say you're bad for me
But who are you to tell me what I need? (I need)
'Cause I like what I like, what I li-li-like
'Cause I like what I li-li-like (What I, what I like, yeah)
Baby, you could say you're bad for me (Uh huh)
But who are you to tell me what I need?
'Cause I like what I like, what I li-li-like (What I)
Yeah, I like what I li-li-like (What I, what I like, yeah)
[Outro: Sabrina Carpenter]
I can't stop me, I can't help myself
(I can't stop me, I can't stop me)
I can't stop me, I can't help myself
(I can't stop me, I can't stop me)
