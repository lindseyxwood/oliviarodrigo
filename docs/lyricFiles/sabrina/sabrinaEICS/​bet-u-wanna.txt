[Verse 1]
Told me, told me I'm your only
It's all unfoldin', babe
Slowly, slowly, lies you sold me
All saw the light of day

[Pre-Chorus]
You been wastin' time on the other side
If you're satisfied, touché
Now you say you hate all the empty space
And if you could go back, you'd stay

[Chorus]
Didn't think about it when you let me down
Hurts to see me outta your reach
Bet you wanna touch me now
It's cold out there, let me know what you found
(Let me know what you found)
Bet you wanna love me now
Bet you wanna love me now

[Verse 2]
Chase me, chase me, that's right, baby
Yeah, feel the way it feels
When you don't havе control of who I'm holdin'
Is it feedin' all your fears?
[Pre-Chorus]
You been wastin' time on the othеr side
If you're satisfied, touché
But the lights are off, your so-called friends are gone
Oh, I know what you're 'bout to say

[Chorus]
Didn't think about it when you let me down
Hurts to see me outta your reach
Bet you wanna touch me now
It's cold out there, let me know what you found
(Let me know what you found)
Bet you wanna love me now
Bet you wanna love me now
Didn't think about it when you let me down
Hurts to see me outta your reach
Bet you wanna touch me now
It's cold out there, let me know what you found
(Let me know what you found)
Bet you wanna love me now
Bet you wanna love me now

[Post-Chorus]
I bet you wanna
I bet you wanna (Ah)
[Bridge]
Bet you miss me, bet you're reminiscin'
I bet you hate the way that you said goodbye
And you still can't even tell me why
I hate the way that you left me dry
But I'll keep that between you and I

[Chorus]
I bet you didn't think about it when you let me down
Hurts to see me outta your reach
Bet you wanna touch me now (Oh, touch me now)
It's cold out there, let me know what you found
Bet you wanna love me now (Uh-huh)
Bet you wanna love me now
