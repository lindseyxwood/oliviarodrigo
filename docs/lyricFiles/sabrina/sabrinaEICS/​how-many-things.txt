[Verse 1]
You used a fork once
It turns out forks are fuckin' everywhere
There’s no hiding from the thought of us
I got ways to find you anywhere
We sat on the roof once
Conversation took us everywhere
And we talked until the sun came up
I wish we stayed just like we were up there

[Pre-Chorus]
I consider you, I'm not trying to
It doesn't matter whether not I want to
I can’t help it, it's a habit
Your corner in my mind is well-established

[Chorus]
I, I wonder how many things you think about before you get to me
I wonder how many things you wanna do, you think I'm in-between
I feel myself fallin' further down your priorities
And I still make excuses for you constantly
I wonder how many things you think about
Before, before you get to me

[Verse 2]
Remember when you left once?
That never made too much sense to me
Well, it hurt you so bad hurting me
You really came to me for sympathy
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I consider you and I'm not trying to
It doesn't matter whether not I want to
I can't help it, it's a habit
Your corner in my mind is well-established

[Chorus]
I, I wonder how many things you think about before you get to me
I wonder how many things you wanna do, you think I’m in-between
And I feel myself falling further down your priorities
And I still make excuses for you constantly
I wonder how many things you think about
Before, before you get to me

[Bridge]
Am I not even a second thought?

[Chorus]
I wonder how many things you think about before you get to me
I wonder how many things you wanna do, you think I’m in-between
I feel myself fallin' further down your priorities
And I still make excuses for you constantly
I wonder how many things you think about
Before, before you get to me

[Outro]
Wonder how many things
