[Verse 1]
We been talkin' for hours
'Bout how we shouldn't talk for hours on end
Kissin' after a conversation
'Bout how we'd probably be better off as friends

[Pre-Chorus]
Same time here next weekend
Say we won't do this again
Make me fall where I stand
Only like you can

[Chorus]
Yeah, I say I'm done, but I'm still confused
How am I supposed to close the door when I still need the closure?
And I change my mind, but it's still on you
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?

[Verse 2]
Selfishly don't wanna give you
Time to be on someone else's lips (Ah)
But I'll take three short hours over
Three long weeks pretendin' like we don't exist, hmm (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Same time here next weekend
Say we won't do this again
Make me fall where I stand
Only like you can
[Chorus]
Yeah, I say I'm done, but I'm still confused
How am I supposed to close the door when I still need the closure?
And I change my mind, but it's still on you
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?

[Bridge]
After the aftermath, I know you'll be comin' back
To the back bedroom and it won't be the last
Of the aftermath, I know you'll be comin' back
To the back bedroom and it won't be the last time

[Chorus]
I say I'm done, but I'm still confused
How am I supposed to close the door when I still need the closure? (Ooh)
And I change my mind, but it's still on you
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?

[Outro]
Yeah, I like my bed, but it likes you too
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?
