[Intro]
Bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time

[Verse 1]
You never finish your glass, take a little sip and you're bored
Down in the apartment below, wouldn't even open your door
You said, "It's a bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time" (Mm)
Too many times, I've asked myself, "What did I come here for?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I know you wanna talk about it, talk about it, yeah
Suddenly, you're into me again
Let's talk about it, talk about it, yeah
I've been dyin' to use the line

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, but you've called at a bad time
And every time is probably gonna be a bad time
Sorry, but it's not like the last time
When you were callin' me and hopin' for a good time
Bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time
You should know about it by now
Bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time
You should know about it by now
You should know about it, na, na, yeah
[Verse 2]
Everything's so clear to me now, wish I coulda seen it before
You were sittin' comfortable and I was busy kissin' your floor

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I know you wanna talk about it, talk about it, yeah
Suddenly, you're into me again
Let's talk about it, talk about it, yeah
I've been dyin' to use the line

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, but you've called at a bad time
And every time is probably gonna be a bad time
Sorry, but it's not like the last time
When you were callin' me and hopin' for a good time
Bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time
You should know about it by now
Bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time (Ah yeah)
You should know about it by now

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, yeah, sorry
La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, yeah, sorry

[Bridge]
Mm, no
It's a really bad time
Hey, hey, mm, now
You know that it's a bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time
I'm just gonna say it one more time for fun
[Chorus]
I'm sorry, but you've called at a bad time
And every time is probably gonna be a bad time (Yeah)
Sorry, but it's not like the last time
When you were callin' me and hopin' for a good time
Bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time
You should know about it by now (Nah, nah, no, no, no)
Bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time
You should know about it by now

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, yeah, sorry (Yeah, yeah)
La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, yeah
You should know about it by now
