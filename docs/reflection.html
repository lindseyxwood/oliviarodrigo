            <p>Our web scrape of the lyric text files from <a href="https://genius.com/"
                    target="blank">Genius</a> provided us with a mostly clean and simple structure.
                However, there was some unnecessary information that we needed to get rid of,
                including the ads on the website that got scraped with the lyrics. We had some
                errors at first when trying to find a way to only select these specific parts, but
                we eventually found an effective way to find all the ads and replace them with
                nothing in order to delete them. </p></div>
            <div class="analysis-container"><h3>Regex</h3>
            <p>Coming up with the regex to convert our text files into XML proved its challenges.
                Capturing the type of section (Verse, Chorus, Bridge) was quite simple as they were
                already in square brackets. However, finding an effective way to turn it into an
                attribute of a section element that wraps around the corresponding lyrics was a lot
                of trial and error. From this experience, we learned how important the order of
                which you execute your Regex is, as each step builds off of one another. </p></div>
